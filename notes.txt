By default typesi n rust are immutable

String is from Standard Library Growable

io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)

:: denotes that an object is an associated fucntion, meaning it is implemented on a type

you can write direct calls to modules by std::io::stdin <-- allows you skip imports

references, denoted by &, allow you to pass the same shared spot to memory, references are by default immutable (duh think singleton principle) 

read_line does not overwrite contents, too long i presume, but this will cause the String to grow to the size of the buffer (or overflow it blah) this is where clearing the buffer with .clear comes in handy

.readlien returns a 'Result' value which is an enumeration
